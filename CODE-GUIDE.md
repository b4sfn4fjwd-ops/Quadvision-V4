# QuadVision — Code Guide (for explaining to the judges)

This is a plain-English tour of how QuadVision is built. You don't need to be a
programmer to use it — each part has a simple "what it does" and a short line you
can say out loud to a judge.

## 1. What the project is (say this first)

> "QuadVision teaches students how to solve quadratic equations. Our novelty is
> that we **show** the method 'completing the square' as a real picture made of
> tiles — the square is actually built in front of you — instead of just giving
> formulas. It works in English and Bahasa Melayu, has a step-by-step
> walkthrough, a photo-scanner that reads a question from a picture, and a
> friendly bear helper called Squary."

## 2. How it's built (the simple version)

It's a website made with the three basic web languages — **HTML** (structure),
**CSS** (the look), and **JavaScript** (the behaviour). No paid tools, no
external frameworks. That keeps it light, free to host, and easy to maintain.

We split the JavaScript into small files, each with one job. Think of it like a
team where everyone has a role:

| File | Its one job (plain words) |
|------|----------------------------|
| `index.html` | The skeleton — what appears on the page. |
| `css/styles.css` | The style — colours, spacing, the Apple-like look, dark mode. |
| `js/math-core.js` | The **brain** — does the actual algebra. |
| `js/visualizer.js` | Draws the **tile picture** (our novelty). |
| `js/grapher.js` | Draws the **graph** (the parabola). |
| `js/i18n.js` | The **translator** — English ⇄ Bahasa Melayu. |
| `js/scanner.js` | The **photo reader** — reads a quadratic from an image. |
| `js/squary.js` | **Squary** the bear helper. |
| `js/app.js` | The **conductor** — connects everything together. |
| `js/ui.js` | Small polish — fade-in-on-scroll and the active menu. |

> Say to the judge: "We separated the code into small files so each part is
> easy to understand, test and improve — the maths is completely separate from
> the drawing and from the design."

## 3. File-by-file — what to say

### `index.html` — the skeleton
Lists every part of the page in order: top bar → headline + the a/b/c input
boxes → three highlight cards → the tile studio + graph → photo scan → a short
"why it works" explanation → the team → footer. Every piece of text is tagged so
the translator can swap its language.

### `css/styles.css` — the look
Holds all the colours and spacing in one place at the top (called "tokens"), so
the whole site stays consistent. It defines the soft pastel theme, the
**dark mode**, the frosted "glass" top bar, the iOS-style buttons and toggles,
and the gentle fade-in animations.
> "All our colours are defined once at the top, so the light and dark themes
> stay perfectly matched."

### `js/math-core.js` — the brain
Takes a, b, c and works out: the answers (roots), the discriminant (how many
answers), the vertex (turning point), the axis of symmetry, and the full
step-by-step working. It can even show exact answers with square-root signs and
fractions. **It does pure maths only — it never draws anything.**
> "This is the part a maths teacher would care about — it's the real algebra,
> kept separate so we can trust it."

### `js/visualizer.js` — the tile picture (OUR NOVELTY)
Draws "completing the square" as area. The blue square is x². The green strips
are the bx term, split in half and wrapped around two sides. That leaves an empty
corner — we add a pink (b/2)² square to fill it, and the whole thing becomes one
perfect square. **Seeing the square get completed is the heart of our project.**
> "Most apps just show steps. We show *why* it's called 'completing the square'
> — because you literally complete a square."

### `js/grapher.js` — the graph
Draws the U-shaped parabola for the same equation and marks the roots (where it
crosses the x-axis), the vertex, and the line of symmetry.
> "The graph and the algebra always agree — students see both at once."

### `js/i18n.js` — the translator
Stores every sentence in English and Bahasa Melayu. One tap on EN/BM changes the
entire site instantly, and it remembers your choice for next time.
> "Fully bilingual — important for Malaysian classrooms."

### `js/scanner.js` — the photo reader
Uses OCR (optical character recognition) to read a printed quadratic from a
photo and fill in a, b, c automatically. It understands many ways of writing the
equation (x², x^2, decimals, the = sign on either side).
> "Students can just snap their textbook question instead of typing."

### `js/squary.js` — the bear helper
Squary greets students, explains each step in a speech bubble (both languages),
points at the graph, throws confetti and gives achievements when they solve one.
He's also alive: his **eyes follow the mouse**, you can **pet him** (3 quick
clicks = hearts), **drag him** around the screen, he **naps** if ignored, and he
**reacts when you switch day/night mode**.
> "Squary keeps younger learners engaged and turns practice into something fun."

### `js/app.js` — the conductor
The glue. It reads the a/b/c boxes, asks the brain for the answer, tells the tile
picture and the graph what to draw, runs the Play / Next / Back buttons, handles
the scan, and switches languages.

### `js/ui.js` — the polish
Makes cards fade and slide up gently as you scroll (like Apple's product pages),
and highlights the menu item for the section you're viewing.

## 4. A 60-second demo script (what to click)

1. **Start:** "Here's a quadratic — x² − 5x + 6." Point at the a/b/c boxes.
2. Press **Visualise**. "Watch the square build itself" — let the tiles animate.
3. Press **Play** on the walkthrough. "It explains each step in words and maths."
4. Point to the **graph**: "the answers are where the curve meets the line."
5. Tap **BM**: "and the whole thing works in Bahasa Melayu."
6. Tap the **photo scan**: "students can scan a question instead of typing."
7. Point at **Squary**: "our helper reacts, celebrates and keeps it fun."
8. Tap **dark mode**: "and it has a polished light and dark theme."

## 5. Questions a judge might ask (with simple answers)

- **"Did you build this yourselves?"** → "Yes — plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
  split into small files, no paid software."
- **"What's new about it?"** → "We show completing the square as a real picture
  of tiles, so students understand *why*, not just *how*."
- **"Who is it for?"** → "Secondary and matriculation students; it's bilingual
  and works on phones, tablets and computers."
- **"Does it work offline?"** → "Everything works offline except the photo
  scanner, which downloads its reader the first time."
- **"How would a school use it?"** → "Open the link or scan a QR code — no
  install. Teachers can demo it; students practise on their own."

## 6. Where to change things

- **Team photos & names:** in `index.html`, the team section — replace the
  images in `assets/team/` and edit each `class="name"`.
- **Text wording / translations:** in `js/i18n.js` (English and Malay together).
- **Colours / theme:** the "design tokens" block at the top of `css/styles.css`.
